# Renewable Energy Certificate

EWF is looking for Solution Architects who have experience with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

We have prepared a take-home project for you to show us your skills and understand what kind of challenges you will see when you join us. This assessment might take 2-4 hours.

Context
At EWF, we are building credential systems which give access to energy industry on-chain use cases. One particular use case might be the issuance of a token which represents, for example, a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC). However, we may want the token to only be issuable by minters that have a certain credential.

Participants
REC Owner
REC Issuer
Certificate Authority
Requirements
The certificate authority defines authorized issuers.
An owner can claim their REC if they present signed proof from an issuer.
The RECs are representative of the US market: https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/renewable-energy-certificates-recs
The participants are entities without dedicated IT departments.


Task
We would like you to design a system for REC issuance that considers the above requirements. You are free to use whatever tools necessary to present your system design.
